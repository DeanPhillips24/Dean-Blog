## Dean Blog - CSSE

This is my first edit on my home page.

I was able to do this by following the instructions on the CSSE website and a little bit of experimenting.

I learned that if you want to put in big text, use two ##'s. I also now know that if you want to add a link, you put the title in brackets and the link in parentheses. [MyConnect](poway.instructure.com)

This is it so far.

## Weekly Progress

8/21-8/25 - I was able to start saving my work and make my first edits on my blog. This included changing the theme, my first change of text, adding my first link, and adding my first image. 

With the help of a friend in CSA, I was able to resize my image and make it wide. Yippeee!!

Here is a picture of my friend Perell.
